# VS Code Backend Modules

This document describes backend runtime modules used by the VS Code extension bridge (`packages/vscode/src/bridge.ts`).

## Purpose

Keep `bridge.ts` as a thin orchestration layer that delegates message handling to cohesive domain runtimes while preserving API behavior.

## Runtime modules

- `bridge.ts`
  - Entry orchestration layer for bridge messages.
  - Delegates to specialized runtimes in order and handles only unmatched fallthrough cases.

- `bridge-git-runtime.ts`
  - Standard Git message handlers.

- `bridge-git-special-runtime.ts`
  - Specialized Git flows (`pr-description`, `conflict-details`) and generation helpers.

- `bridge-git-process-runtime.ts`
  - Git process execution and environment setup (`execGit`), including SSH agent socket resolution.

- `bridge-fs-runtime.ts`
  - Bridge handlers for filesystem-related message routes.
  - Uses shared FS helpers via injected dependencies.

- `bridge-fs-helpers-runtime.ts`
  - Filesystem/path/search helper functions:
    - path normalization and resolution
    - directory listing
    - file search
    - file read path safety checks
    - dropped-file parsing and attachment reading

- `bridge-localfs-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Local `/api/fs/read` and `/api/fs/raw` proxy helpers and shared proxy utility helpers.
  - Optional file reads signal existence through `x-openchamber-file-exists` while preserving plain-text bodies.

- `reasoning-projection.ts`
  - OpenChamber outbound reasoning projection (`includeReasoning=false`, strict
    string only). HTTP snapshot helpers + per-connection stateful SSE filter.
  - Drops `type=reasoning` parts, reasoning deltas, unknown part deltas, and
    `session.next.reasoning.*` (dispatch strips terminal `.N` version suffixes;
    kept events preserve original `type`). Keeps `tokens.reasoning`. Never mutates
    inputs; never forwards the query param to OpenCode. SSE splitter holds a
    trailing CR so CRLF across chunks cannot split one event.
  - Used by `sseProxy.ts`, `bridge-proxy-runtime.ts`, and
    `bridge-session-turn-page-runtime.ts`. Internal watchers stay full-fidelity.

- `sseProxy.ts`
  - Extension Host SSE proxy to OpenCode `/event` and `/global/event`.
  - Reads `includeReasoning` from the webview path query; strips it before the
    upstream OpenCode fetch. When `'false'`, parse-filters SSE blocks before
    `api:sse:chunk` postMessage, and emits `:heartbeat\n\n` every 10s while no
    downstream chunk was sent (keeps the webview 30s SSE idle timeout alive
    during pure-reasoning upstream). Enabled path remains byte passthrough with
    no synthetic heartbeat.

- `bridge-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Proxy route handlers (`api:proxy`, `api:session:message`) with injected helper dependencies.
  - Exact `GET /session/:sessionID/message/:messageID` responses are L1-projected
    (`summary.diffs` → thin `{ file, status?, additions, deletions }[]` plus
    additive `diffCount` / `hasDiffs`) on the Extension Host before the payload
    enters the webview. Full `parts` behavior is preserved unless
    `includeReasoning=false` (then `type=reasoning` parts are removed after L1).
  - Official `GET /session/:sessionID/message` list responses apply the same
    reasoning strip when `includeReasoning=false`. The param is stripped before
    OpenCode upstream.

- `session-turn-page-runtime.ts`
  - Pure turn-window aggregation over official OpenCode `session.messages` pages.
  - Exports `isUserAuthoredTurnBoundary`, `selectTurnRecords`,
    `encodeHostCursor` / `decodeHostCursor`, `projectSlimParts`,
    `projectMessageSummaryDiffCounts`, `projectExactMessagePayload`,
    `SLIM_PARTS_PROJECTION`, and
    `createSessionTurnPageService({ fetchPage, maxScanPages?, maxScanMessages? })`.
  - Turn-page `slim-v1` projection is Host-parity (first packet and prepend): message
    `summary.diffs` is kept as a thin L1 file list (`file` / `status?` /
    `additions` / `deletions` only; no patch bodies) with additive markers
    `diffCount` / `hasDiffs`; tool / reasoning / file summaries after
    `selectTurnRecords`. Slim tools
    keep short locator input
    (path / pattern / query / command / `subagent_type` / `description` / skill `name` / `id`),
    `metadata.sessionId`, skill `metadata.name`, and edit `additions`/`deletions`, and drop result bodies. Slim `file` parts keep identity, mime,
    filename, and size metadata only — never `url` or base64. Clients must
    hydrate the full message by `messageID` before rendering or editing an
    attachment.
  - OpenCode pages are chronological (oldest → newest); older pages are prepended
    with info.id dedupe (no reverse). Missing `info.id` → explicit `upstream` error.
  - Client-facing `cursor` is an opaque Host token (`oc1.` + base64url JSON) with
    `{ before, boundaryID }`: `before` is the upstream request cursor of the page
    that held the earliest selected authored user boundary; `boundaryID` is that
    message id. Raw OpenCode cursors on the first request pass through unchanged.
  - Resuming with a Host token re-fetches the origin page with the decoded raw
    `before`, keeps only records strictly older than `boundaryID`
    (`slice(0, index)`), then continues with raw `nextCursor` until the turn
    budget is met. Malformed token, missing boundary, or `before` over 4096 chars
    → `invalid_cursor` (no partial records).
  - `complete` is true only when upstream is exhausted and
    `selected.length === accumulated.length` (no overscan trim). When incomplete,
    cursor encodes the earliest selected authored user origin.
  - Authored user turn boundary excludes fully synthetic, subtask, compaction, and
    hosted session dividers; empty user parts still count.
  - Hard scan caps: 50 pages / 5000 messages; no partial success on stall or cap.

- `bridge-session-turn-page-runtime.ts`
  - Bridge handler for `api:session-turn-page`.
  - Reads OpenCode base URL + auth from the manager, requests official
    `/session/:id/message?limit=&before=&directory=` with **raw** OpenCode cursors
    only (Host tokens are decoded in the aggregator; never forwarded upstream),
    reads `x-next-cursor`, and returns unified
    `{ records, cursor, complete, turnCount, partsProjection }` where `cursor`
    is an opaque Host token when history remains. `partsProjection` is
    `slim-v1` on every turn-page response (first packet and prepend).
  - Optional payload `includeReasoning` (from webview query): only strict
    `'false'` drops entire `type=reasoning` parts after slim-v1; keeps
    `tokens.reasoning`. Missing/other values keep slim reasoning identity.
  - Maps `invalid_cursor` to a safe client error string; never logs message
    contents, tokens, or secrets.
  - Whole aggregation uses a 45s AbortController timeout (signal forwarded; cleared
    in `finally`).
  - Delegated from `bridge.ts` before the generic proxy handler.

- `session-turn-changes-runtime.ts`
  - Pure L2/L3 helpers matching web host `changes.service.js`.
  - L2: project `summary.diffs` → `{ files: [{ file, status?, additions, deletions }] }`.
  - L3: exact `file` match from official `session.diff` → `{ diff }`.

- `bridge-session-turn-changes-runtime.ts`
  - Bridge handler for `api:session-turn-changes`.
  - L2 uses official legacy `/session/:id/message/:messageID`; L3 uses
    `/session/:id/diff?messageID=`. Extension Host filters before returning to
    the webview. Delegated from `bridge.ts` before the generic proxy handler.

- `bridge-config-runtime.ts`
  - Config and skills message handlers (`api:config/*`).
  - Includes OpenCode resolution diagnostics parity handler used by shared UI (`/api/config/opencode-resolution`).
  - Skills list, detail/CRUD, files, catalog, scan, and install requests carry the
    webview directory hint. Directory-sensitive handlers resolve that payload at
    call time, so project-scoped skills match the shared UI query directory.
  - Provider catalogs are projected through the Extension Host safe-field allowlist
    before they reach the webview.
  - Skill `summary=true` and command metadata `{ catalog: true }` requests return
    compact autocomplete contracts without skill content, sources, or command templates.

- `bridge-settings-runtime.ts`
  - Settings read/write, OpenCode skills discovery, and provider catalog API access for bridge consumers.
  - Full settings responses use an explicit non-sensitive DesktopSettings allowlist and expose stored tunnel and summary credentials only through their `has*` indicators.

- `settings-visible-runtime.ts`
  - Pure formatter for the full settings response allowlist and credential-presence indicators.

- `settings-bootstrap-runtime.ts`
  - Projects the bounded, secret-free settings bootstrap contract at the Extension Host boundary.
  - Validates bootstrap STT URLs as credential-free HTTP(S) URLs and restricts transport, STT provider, and response-style values to their supported enums.

- `provider-catalog-runtime.ts`
  - Pure bounded provider catalog projection at the Extension Host trust boundary.
  - Rejects malformed top-level responses and marks isolated invalid entities as partial.
  - Limits providers, models, defaults, and variants; validates identifiers and scalar bounds; and emits null-prototype dictionaries for dynamic catalog maps.
  - Requires a non-empty bridge directory and treats SDK errors as catalog failures before projection.

- `bridge-system-runtime.ts`
  - System/editor/provider/quota/notification/update-check message handlers.
  - Includes session activity snapshot bridge handler used by webview parity routes (`/api/session-activity`).
  - Includes Zen utility model parity handler used by shared notification settings (`/api/zen/models`).

## Webview local notification gate

Ordinary VS Code native notifications are decided in the webview
(`webview/main.tsx` listening for `openchamber:vscode-notification-event`), not
on the Extension Host. Session eligibility is pure logic in
`webview/notificationSessionFilter.ts` (`shouldSkipVSCodeNotificationSession`):

- Skip missing sessions and any session with a non-empty `parentID` (child /
  subagent).
- Skip system-owned sessions by authoritative OpenChamber metadata only:
  non-empty `smallModel.purpose`, non-empty `llm.purpose` (LLM gateway
  throwaways), non-empty `scheduledTask.taskID`, and non-empty
  `assistant.assistantID` unless `assigned.from === 'contact'`.
- Contact-assigned worker sessions stay eligible and still notify.
- Empty `smallModel.purpose` / `llm.purpose` strings do **not** hide a session
  (same contract as Host `notifications/runtime.js` and UI
  `globalSessions.isSystemOwnedSession`).

## Extension guideline

The VS Code webview returns `501 { code: 'unavailable' }` for the message-queue
server route family. This explicit response precedes the generic OpenCode proxy,
so shared UI worktree-order synchronization exits cleanly in this runtime.

Session turn-page (`GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/messages`) is an
OpenChamber-owned webview route (`webview/sessionTurnPageRoute.ts`). It is
matched ahead of the generic OpenCode proxy, validates `turns` (1..10) and
`scanLimit` (10..200), forwards optional `includeReasoning` query to the bridge,
dispatches `api:session-turn-page` to the Extension Host, and returns the same
unified JSON contract as the web host module
(`packages/web/server/lib/session-turn-pages/`), including opaque Host cursors
(`oc1.` tokens). Non-GET → 405; illegal query → 400.

Reasoning projection (`includeReasoning=false`) is per webview request/SSE
stream on the Extension Host send boundary (parity with web Host
`event-stream/reasoning-projection.js`). Internal watchers stay full-fidelity.
VS Code does not implement transcript-cache read or messages/reconcile routes;
those remain Host-only when present.

Session turn-changes (`GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/changes`) is an
OpenChamber-owned webview route (`webview/sessionTurnChangesRoute.ts`). It is
matched ahead of the generic OpenCode proxy, requires `messageID`, optionally
accepts `file` and `directory`, dispatches `api:session-turn-changes`, and
returns `{ files }` (L2) or `{ diff }` (L3). Non-GET → 405; illegal query → 400.

The exact `GET /api/config/settings/bootstrap` webview route dispatches to
`api:config/settings:bootstrap` before the generic settings route. The legacy
`GET /api/config/settings?bootstrap=true` form remains supported.

When adding new bridge route families:

1. Prefer creating or extending a domain runtime module under `packages/vscode/src/bridge-*-runtime.ts`.
2. Keep `bridge.ts` focused on delegation order and minimal fallthrough behavior.
3. Inject dependencies into runtimes instead of reaching into unrelated modules directly.
