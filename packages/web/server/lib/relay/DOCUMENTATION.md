# Relay Module Documentation

## Purpose

The private relay lets an OpenChamber client (mobile app, browser, or another desktop) reach a user's OpenChamber instance through OpenChamber-hosted infrastructure when the instance is not directly reachable (behind NAT or without a public URL). The instance dials **outbound** to the relay; nothing needs to be exposed inbound.

Traffic is **end-to-end encrypted between the two endpoints** (client and host instance). The relay infrastructure forwards opaque ciphertext and cannot read application traffic — it is an untrusted transport, not a trusted middlebox.

This module (`packages/web/server/lib/relay/`) is the **Host side** of the private relay. **Only the Electron desktop runtime may act as a relay host** (`OPENCHAMBER_RUNTIME=desktop`, set by Electron before it starts the in-process web server). Plain `node` / `dev:web:hmr` / CLI / VS Code web servers must not open the host-control socket, claim `relay-host.lock`, or advertise a host pairing candidate — even when they share the same data dir as desktop. Those processes may still run the API that *clients* use; mobile and other desktops remain **relay clients**. The **Client side** lives in `packages/ui/src/lib/relay/`. Hosted Relay instances may run in a Worker. The self-hosted **Relay server** belongs to `packages/relay-server/` and brokers Layer 1 connections.

## The three layers

Traffic is modeled as three stacked layers. The relay understands only Layer 1; Layers 2–3 exist solely between the client and the host.

1. **Relay routing (Layer 1)** — outbound WebSocket connections to the relay, connection brokering, and host authentication to the relay. The relay routes each client to the correct host and forwards frames verbatim.
2. **End-to-end encryption (Layer 2)** — an authenticated encrypted channel established directly between client and host, keyed so the relay cannot participate. Built on standard WebCrypto primitives (ECDH key agreement + AEAD framing). The host's encryption public key is distributed to the client out-of-band via the pairing payload and is the client's trust anchor.
3. **Tunnel multiplexing (Layer 3)** — because an OpenChamber client speaks many concurrent HTTP requests, an event stream (SSE), and WebSockets to one origin, the encrypted channel carries a small multiplexing protocol. It frames HTTP request/response (including streamed bodies) and WebSocket sub-streams so the whole app works over one encrypted connection.

## Entrypoints and structure

Host side (`packages/web/server/lib/relay/`):
- `service.js` — thin entrypoint: relay config (enabled flag + relay URL), the management routes (`GET/POST /api/openchamber/relay/{status,enable,disable}`), a `getPairingCandidate()` accessor (the relay transport candidate folded into pairing-v2 links when enabled, consumed by the pairing-session route in `core-routes.js`), and lifecycle wiring. Host lifecycle is gated to Electron: non-desktop runtimes (`bun run dev`, `dev:web:hmr`, CLI `serve`, VS Code, plain `node server`) report `state: 'unavailable'`, refuse `/relay/enable`, `/relay/disable`, and relay pairing with 403, never mint a relay identity, never advertise `relayAvailable`, and never call `startRelayHost`. Direct `node server/index.js` forces `OPENCHAMBER_RUNTIME=web` so a leftover desktop env cannot open the host-control socket. On desktop, started from `packages/web/server/index.js` only when demand/opt-in enables the relay. The relay endpoint defaults to the OpenChamber-hosted relay but can be pinned to a self-hosted relay via the `OPENCHAMBER_RELAY_URL` env var; when set it overrides the stored setting for the host connection, the pairing candidate, and status, so paired clients inherit the endpoint automatically. Endpoint identity is scheme/host/path only: accepted schemes are `ws://` and `wss://`; URLs with userinfo are rejected (no silent default fallback); query and fragment are stripped before persistence and pairing candidates. Custom endpoint persistence and Host control-connection switching are explicit authenticated management actions. Pairing creation with `relayUrl` requires an owner UI session or the local `desktop-local` shell client; `/relay/enable` follows its API auth gate.
- `identity.js` — the host's stable identity: the long-lived signing keypair (shared with the push relay, defines the routing id) plus a long-lived encryption keypair (the E2EE trust anchor). Reused across restarts; never rotated implicitly.
- `signing-key.js` — storage/derivation of the signing keypair and the routing id, shared with the notifications runtime.
- `host-client.js` — the long-lived connection manager: one outbound control connection to the relay, a per-client data connection for each connected device, reconnect/backoff, and the E2EE responder handshake per connection.
- `host-lock.js` — the per-machine host claim. Every local instance sharing the data dir shares the relay identity (same serverId), so concurrent relay hosts evict each other at the relay worker (`4001: Control replaced`) and paired devices land on whichever local process won last. The claim file (`<data-dir>/relay-host.lock`, `{ pid }`) makes this deterministic: `service.js` only starts the host when no LIVE process holds the claim (stale claims from dead pids are ignored), goes to `standby` otherwise, and a 30s watcher both takes over when the claimant dies and stands down when another process claims. Explicit user intent — creating a pairing link or hitting `/relay/enable` — force-claims; the previous holder's watcher sees the takeover and backs off instead of fighting. The claim is cooperative (the relay worker still enforces the single host slot); it only decides which process keeps retrying.
- `tunnel-host.js` — the per-connection dispatcher: decrypts tunnel frames and forwards HTTP/SSE/WS to the local server over loopback, then streams responses back. Enforces a path allowlist and never injects credentials.
- `e2ee.js`, `tunnel-codec.js` — host-side (JS) mirrors of the shared crypto and framing (see "Two implementations" below).

Client side (`packages/ui/src/lib/relay/`):
- `protocol.ts` — the shared contract: constants, frame types, message shapes. The normative source both implementations follow.
- `crypto.ts`, `handshake.ts` — the E2EE primitives and handshake state machines (initiator + responder).
- `tunnel-codec.ts` — Layer 3 frame codec, fragmentation, and outbound frame batching.
- `tunnel-client.ts` — the client tunnel: exposes a `fetch()`-compatible and a WebSocket-compatible surface backed by the encrypted tunnel.
- `tunnel-payloads.ts`, `runtime-tunnel.ts`, `runtime-socket.ts` — payload helpers, the active-tunnel singleton, and the shared "open a runtime WebSocket the right way" helper.

Relay is not a separate link format: it is one transport candidate inside the unified **pairing v2** payload (`packages/ui/src/lib/connectionPayload.ts`). A relay candidate is `{ type: 'relay', relayUrl, serverId, hostEncPubJwk }` — no embedded token; the client redeems the one-time pairing secret over the tunnel like any other candidate.

## What travels the tunnel

Everything a client normally sends to the single OpenChamber origin:
- **HTTP** — REST endpoints and proxied OpenCode SDK calls under `/api/*`, plus `/auth/*` and `/health`.
- **SSE** — streamed responses opened through `runtimeFetch`, including `/api/openchamber/events` and SDK global SSE. Relay carries these HTTP response body frames through the tunnel.
- **WebSocket** — the endpoints that use a real socket (the global event stream on platforms that support WS, terminal I/O, dictation).

The host dispatcher restricts tunneled traffic to explicit path allowlists (one for HTTP, one for WS).

### Catalog and new HTTP API pitfalls over Relay

Private Relay is transparent for allowlisted HTTP paths, so most “works on LAN / Desktop, empty on mobile Relay” bugs are Host routing or client transport-identity mistakes rather than Relay framing bugs:

- **Same path, real Host route required.** Clients call the ordinary `/api/...` path through the tunnel. If that route is missing on the Host process currently holding the relay claim (wrong git worktree, stale packaged Desktop build, or a backend that never registered the OpenChamber route before the OpenCode proxy/SPA fallback), the tunnel still returns HTTP 200 with SPA HTML or proxied OpenCode content. Symptom: chat and status work, Provider/model catalog does not.
- **HTTP allowlist is prefix-based for `/api/`.** New REST/SSE APIs under `/api/` do not need a tunnel-host allowlist edit. New **WebSocket** paths still need both `ALLOWED_WS_PATHS` and `isUrlAuthWebSocketPath` (see the `relay-transport` skill). Config sync (`/api/openchamber/config-sync/*`, ticket 05/06) therefore works over Relay without a tunnel-host allowlist change; identity and credential grants remain endpoint concerns (`relay:<serverId>`, pairing-settings / inbound host grant).
- **Transport identity ≠ runtime key.** After LAN⇄relay swaps, UI catalog loaders commit only when `useConfigStore.catalogTransportIdentity` matches `getRuntimeTransportIdentity()`. `runtimeEndpointReset.ts` must write that transport fingerprint on both full endpoint reset and in-place transport reconnect. Writing `runtimeKey` instead leaves Providers empty because the stable device/instance id is shared across LAN and relay.
- **Safe catalog projection stays Host-owned.** Provider credentials never cross the browser; Relay only carries the already-allowlisted `GET /api/config/catalog/providers` JSON. Keep Host projection, client parser bounds, and `partial` rules in sync (empty `release_date` is absent, not partial).

See also `packages/web/server/lib/opencode/DOCUMENTATION.md` (“Catalog / OpenChamber-owned API change checklist”) and `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md` (Provider catalog / `catalogTransportIdentity`).

## Authentication model

- The tunnel is **transport only**. The OpenChamber server still authenticates every tunneled request exactly as it authenticates a direct remote client. The relay path grants reachability, not authorization.
- Clients carry their normal credential. HTTP and SSE requests authenticate with the client's bearer token (a header). **WebSocket upgrades cannot send headers**, so they authenticate with a short-lived URL-scoped token minted beforehand and passed as a query parameter. This asymmetry is important when adding new WebSocket features (see the skill).
- The host authenticates itself to the relay with a signed handshake using its long-lived signing key.
- Enabling the relay is explicit opt-in and disabled by default; disabling it severs all relay reachability immediately.

## End-to-end flow (overview)

1. **Pairing.** The host issues a pairing-v2 link (QR / deep link) carrying a one-time secret and a list of transport candidates. When the relay is enabled, one candidate is the relay transport (its endpoint, routing id, and encryption public key — the E2EE trust anchor). The client redeems the secret over the first reachable candidate; over the relay candidate it opens the E2EE tunnel first, then redeems through it, and stores the connection.
2. **Presence.** When the relay is enabled, the host opens one outbound control connection and waits.
3. **Connect.** The client connects for a given routing id; the relay notifies the host over the control connection; the host opens a matching per-client data connection.
4. **Handshake.** Over that connection pair, client and host run the E2EE handshake and derive a shared encrypted channel the relay cannot read.
5. **Traffic.** All normal app traffic is multiplexed and encrypted through that channel. On the host, decrypted requests are dispatched to the local server over loopback; responses stream back encrypted. Reconnects re-establish a fresh channel and the app's existing retry machinery recovers.

## Candidate refresh (staying off the relay when direct works)

Pairing-payload transport candidates are a snapshot: when DHCP hands the host
machine a new LAN address, a device's saved direct candidate goes stale and the
device silently degrades to relay-only. To recover, an already-paired client can
call `GET /api/client-auth/connection/candidates` (UI session or client bearer;
registered with the auth/access routes) over any live transport — including
through the tunnel — to learn the server's **current** LAN URLs plus the relay
candidate, and update its saved candidate set (mobile: `mobileConnections.ts`;
desktop: `desktopRelayRestore.ts`).

Identity gating: the response carries the stable `serverId` (base64url SHA-256 of
the public signing JWK — the same identity the relay routes by, exposed by the
relay service's `getServerId()` and echoed unauthenticated on `/health` and
`/api/version`). Clients ignore a refresh whose `serverId` does not match their
pinned relay identity, and verify `/health`'s `serverId` on a learned address
**before** sending their bearer token to it — a re-assigned LAN address may now
belong to a different machine.

## Two implementations, kept in sync

The E2EE and framing logic exists twice: TypeScript in `packages/ui/src/lib/relay/` (shared by the client and the normative reference) and a JavaScript mirror in this module (the host, which is plain JS ESM). They **must stay byte-compatible** — a client encrypted by one must decrypt on the other. A cross-compatibility test (`cross-compat.test.js`) imports the TS modules directly and exercises a full TS-client ↔ JS-host exchange. Any change to the wire format, frame codec, handshake, or batching must update both sides and keep that test green (`bunx vitest run --project @openchamber/web packages/web/server/lib/relay/cross-compat.test.js`). Compiled Host/Client e2e: `bunx vitest run --project @openchamber/web packages/web/server/lib/relay/relay-server.e2e.test.ts`.

## Runtime integration (client)

Relay mode plugs into the existing client transport layer rather than a parallel path: `runtime-switch` activates the tunnel singleton, `runtime-fetch` routes runtime requests and product SSE streamed responses through it, `runtime-url` builds browser-consumed URLs, `runtime-socket` opens tunneled WebSockets, and `runtime-auth` mints the URL-scoped token through the tunnel. Direct-URL connections and the Electron realtime-proxy path are unaffected.

### Transport identity vs runtime key (do not mix)

`runtimeKey` is the stable device/instance id. It stays the same across LAN⇄relay for one paired device. `getRuntimeTransportIdentity()` is the active transport fingerprint (`direct:…` / `relay:…`) and changes when the client switches transports.

Catalog loaders (`loadProviders` / `loadAgents`) and assistant Query keys gate writes/caches on the **transport fingerprint**, not `runtimeKey`. On endpoint reset and same-device transport switch, `runtimeEndpointReset.ts` must set `useConfigStore.catalogTransportIdentity` to `getRuntimeTransportIdentity()`. Writing `detail.runtimeKey` there silently discards provider/agent catalog refreshes under Relay, which then hides capability-gated surfaces such as Assistants.

## SSH host routing

Mobile (and other relay clients) can reach a desktop's **SSH-forwarded remote OpenChamber instances** through the same private-relay tunnel that already reaches the desktop's local loopback origin. Routing is host-side only: the client selects a target local-forward port; the tunnel dispatcher dials that port on `127.0.0.1` when — and only when — it is present in the live SSH routing table.

### Header contract

- Header name: `x-openchamber-target-port`
- Value: decimal port number string (e.g. `"41234"`)
- HTTP: carried on the tunneled request headers
- WebSocket: optional `headers` field on the `WsOpen` payload (same header name/value)
- The dispatcher **strips** this header before forwarding to loopback (it is routing metadata, not an upstream header)

### Resolution rules (`resolveTargetPort` in `tunnel-host.js`)

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Header absent | Dial `getLocalPort()` (desktop local origin) — unchanged default behavior |
| Header present and `localPort` is in `getSshRoutingTable()` | Dial that port |
| Header present but port missing/invalid/not in table | **Do not** fall back to the default port |

HTTP miss → synthetic **503** with body `{ error: 'ssh-host-unreachable', …, source: 'relay-tunnel-host' }`.  
WS miss → stream abort with reason `ssh-host-unreachable`.

### Routing table (authoritative in memory)

- Electron injects `getSshRoutingTable: () => sshManager.getRoutingTable()` into `startWebUiServer`.
- Table entries are `{ id, localPort }` for SSH sessions whose status phase is **`ready`** and whose `localPort` is finite.
- Degraded / connecting / disconnected sessions are absent. Settings.json is **not** the allowlist for dialing — only the live table is.
- Non-desktop runtimes default to `() => []`.

### Companion HTTP APIs (authenticated `/api` gate)

- `GET /api/openchamber/desktop-hosts` → `{ hosts: [{ id, label, localPort, reachable }] }` for configured SSH instances. `reachable` is true iff the host id is in the routing table. **Never returns `clientToken`.**
- `POST /api/openchamber/ssh-host-token` body `{ hostId }` → `{ token }` from `settings.json` `desktopHosts[].clientToken` for SSH instance hosts only. Missing / non-SSH / no token → **404**. Response includes `Cache-Control: no-store`.

### Security invariants (do not regress)

- Path allowlists (`isAllowedHttpPath` / `ALLOWED_WS_PATHS`) are **not** relaxed for SSH targets.
- The dispatcher **never injects credentials**; the client still authenticates with its own bearer / `oc_url_token` against the target instance.
- Port legitimacy is solely the in-memory routing table, not client-supplied trust and not settings alone.
- List endpoints must not leak `clientToken`; token mint is a separate authenticated POST.

## Design invariants (do not regress)

- The relay never sees plaintext application traffic; it sees only routing metadata (routing id, connection identifiers, timestamps, coarse counts).
- Pairing secrets travel in URL fragments only, never in query strings, never logged.
- Relay endpoint URLs accept only `ws://`/`wss://`, reject userinfo, and drop query/fragment so settings and candidates never store credentials or non-identity URL parts.
- The host dispatcher never injects credentials; the server authenticates each tunneled request.
- The tunnel is transparent to the app: adding relay support to a feature should not require the feature to know the relay exists — it goes through the shared runtime transport helpers.
- The two implementations stay byte-compatible and the wire format is versioned/negotiated so mixed client/host app versions degrade gracefully rather than break.
- SSH target-port routing never falls back to the default local port on a routing-table miss (see "SSH host routing").
