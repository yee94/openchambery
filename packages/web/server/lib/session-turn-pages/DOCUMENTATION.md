# Session Turn Pages Module

## Purpose

OpenChamber-owned turn-window pagination and anchor reconcile for session messages.

1. **Turn pages** — clients request the last N **authored user turns** (default 3) rather than a raw message count. The host loops official OpenCode `session.messages` pages (`limit` / `before` / `x-next-cursor`) until the turn budget is met or history is exhausted.
2. **Anchor reconcile** — after SSE reconnect, clients request the gap from a stable turn-boundary anchor to the current head. The host scans newest→older, returns chronological gap records (including the anchor's overlap turn), and paginates via host-owned continuation tokens with page/byte/total budgets.

Exposed as:

- `GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/messages`
- `GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/messages/reconcile`
- `GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/changes` (L2 file list / L3 single-file patch)
- `GET /api/session/:sessionID/message/:messageID` (exact message with L1 summary projection; registered before the generic OpenCode proxy)

## Why this exists

Official OpenCode pagination is message-count based and uses **opaque** cursors (not message ids). Each upstream page is chronological **old→new** (including the latest slice). UI prepend/load-more needs a stable turn boundary so synthetic loop messages, subtasks, and compaction rows do not consume the turn budget. This module aggregates upstream pages on the host, returns chronological records, and exposes a continuous **host-owned opaque cursor** that points just before the earliest returned authored user.

## Scope

- OpenChamber feature logic, separate from the generic OpenCode proxy.
- Registered in `feature-routes-runtime.js` **before** the generic proxy.
- Global `/api/*` auth is enforced by `core-routes.js` (`requireApiAuth`); this module does not add redundant auth middleware.
- No secrets, bearer tokens, pairing credentials, paths, or upstream response bodies are logged.
- Host cursors never embed message content — only boundary location metadata.

## Query contract

| Param | Default | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `turns` | `3` | `1..10` | Authored user turn budget (product limit) |
| `scanLimit` | **omitted** | `10..200` when present | Optional override only. Host→OpenCode local page size; when omitted it resolves to `_inner_scanLimit`. Clients should omit this. |
| `before` | omitted | opaque string ≤ 8192 chars | Resume older history: host cursor (`oc1.…`) or raw OpenCode SDK cursor on first page |
| `directory` | omitted | path string | Forwarded to directory-scoped OpenCode client |

Invalid `turns`, explicit invalid `scanLimit`, or `before` (malformed/stale host token, oversize) → HTTP 400.

**`_inner_scanLimit`**: resolved once at process start from env (clamped 10..200). Host always calls OpenCode on loopback; scan chunk is not a client-network concern. Final response size is still turn-trimmed via `selectTurnRecords`.

### Upstream page width policy

Width resolves in priority order: **explicit client `scanLimit` → env `OPENCHAMBER_SESSION_TURN_SCAN_LIMIT` → `100`**. The same width applies to every path.

**Do not narrow the width per path to speed up a first paint — it was tried and measured, and it does not work.** What the client receives is the turn-trimmed window, whose size is set by `turns`, not by the page width; width only changes how the Host chunks its loopback reads. On a real tool-heavy session (817 messages, assistant:user ≈ 17:1) the 6th authored-user boundary sat at newest-position 56, so a width of 100 satisfied a 6-turn budget in **one** upstream request while a derived width of 24 needed **three** sequential ones for a byte-identical response.

Narrowing only helps when boundary density is high enough that the newest page carries far more boundaries than the budget. Long-running tool-heavy sessions — the case this module exists to serve — are the opposite. Measurements and the reproduction script live in `.scratch/progressive-transcript-hydration/issues/01-validate-first-packet-page-width.md`.

The lever that does shrink a first packet is the **turn budget** (`turns=1` measured 27 KB against `turns=6` at 3728 KB on that session), plus the parts projection below.

All existing guards (`max_scan_pages`, `max_scan_messages`, `duplicate_cursor`, `empty_page_with_cursor`) are untouched.

## Response contract

Success `200`:

```json
{
  "records": [{ "info": { "id": "...", "role": "user" }, "parts": [] }],
  "turnCount": 1,
  "cursor": "oc1.…",
  "complete": false,
  "partsProjection": "slim-v1"
}
```

- `records`: chronological oldest → newest, including intermediate non-boundary rows (synthetic, tools, subtask, compaction) inside the window.
- `turnCount`: count of authored user boundaries in `records`.
- `cursor`: host-owned opaque token for the next `before=` request; `null` when `complete` is true. The token represents the position **just before** the earliest returned authored user (so the client can load older history without overlap).
- `complete`: `upstreamComplete && selected.length === accumulated.length`. True when upstream history is exhausted **and** `selectTurnRecords` did not trim any older scanned rows (nothing left for the client). When the scan window held more than N turns and older rows were trimmed, `complete` stays `false` with a `cursor` so the client can fetch the trimmed history.
- `partsProjection`: `"slim-v1"` on every turn-page response (first packet and prepend). Names the projection applied to `records`; see below. Reconcile responses omit this field and keep full parts.

### Turn-page payload projection

Every turn-page response summarizes `tool`, `reasoning`, and `file` parts plus message `summary.diffs` so it does not have to carry the bodies of a long tool-heavy turn, inline attachment data URLs, or full file patches. Projection runs **after** `selectTurnRecords`, so `turnCount`, `complete`, and cursor encoding are all derived from unprojected records and cannot shift.

### Changes Host contract (L1 / L2 / L3)

| Layer | Surface | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Turn pages, reconcile response pages, message/session SSE fan-out, exact `GET /api/session/:sessionID/message/:messageID` | Any `info.summary.diffs` **array** is projected to a **slim file list** `[{ file, status?, additions, deletions }]` plus additive markers `summary.diffCount: number` and `summary.hasDiffs: boolean`. Patch/before/after/from/to and other heavy bodies are stripped. Other lightweight summary fields are preserved. `diffCount` equals the slim array length; `hasDiffs === diffCount > 0`. Consumers may use either the slim array or the markers. |
| **L2** | `GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/changes?messageID=` (no `file`) | Host reads official `session.message` locally, returns only `{ files: [{ file, status?, additions, deletions }] }`. Never returns patch/before/after/from/to or the full message envelope. |
| **L3** | Same route with `file=` | Host calls official `session.diff({ sessionID, messageID, directory })`, returns `{ diff: SnapshotFileDiff }` for the exact `file` string match (includes that file's patch). No match → HTTP 404 `{ error: 'change file not found', code: 'change_not_found' }`. Older hosts may ignore `file=` and answer 200 `{ files }` (L2 only). Current clients treat a 200 without `{ diff }` as missing L3 and fall back to official `session.diff`. |

Exact message GET keeps the official `{ info, parts }` response shape and only applies L1 summary projection so materialize/recovery never relays raw multi-megabyte patch bodies through the generic proxy. Abort/45s timeout semantics match the turn-page routes. Global `/api` auth still applies.

Changes query guards: `sessionID` / `messageID` length `1..512`; optional `file` length `1..4096` and rejects control characters / NUL. Failures: invalid params → 400, abort → 499, upstream/malformed → 502. Logs carry only safe flags and ids — never paths, patch bodies, or tokens.


| Kept | Dropped |
|---|---|
| `tool`: `id`, `sessionID`, `messageID`, `callID`, `tool`, `state.status`, `state.title`, `state.time`, slim locator `state.input` (`path` / `pattern` / `command` / `subagent_type` / `description` / skill `name` / `id` / …), slim `state.metadata` (`sessionId`, skill `name`, `additions` / `deletions`) | `state.output`, write `content`, task `prompt`, patch/diff bodies, other metadata, `state.error` |
| `reasoning`: `id`, `sessionID`, `messageID`, `time` | reasoning `text` body |
| `file` (user and assistant): `id`, `sessionID`, `messageID`, `type`, `mime`, `filename`, existing stable `size` / `width` / `height`, derived `byteSize` | `url`, base64, attachment body |

Rules:

- Every projected part carries `slim: true`. An unstamped part is full content. The host never lets a projection look full.
- Slim tool input keeps only short locator and task-identity fields (path, pattern, query, command, `subagent_type`, `description`, skill `name` / `id`). Slim metadata keeps `sessionId`, skill `name`, plus edit `additions`/`deletions`. Projection still drops result bodies, task prompts, patches, and large write payloads.
- Assistant `text` stays intact. User rows are no longer wholesale pass-through: their `file` parts are projected; other user parts stay as-is.
- `file` projection keeps already-present size/width/height (top-level or `metadata`). `byteSize` is derived from a data URL when present. PNG/GIF/JPEG/WebP headers may fill missing `width`/`height`. Unknown dimensions omit those fields.
- Message `info.summary.diffs` is L1-projected to a slim file list plus `diffCount` / `hasDiffs` (never patch bodies). Reconcile preserves full parts and applies this same L1 summary projection to response-page byte budgeting and serialization; raw upstream scan budgets retain raw bytes. Clients that need a dedicated file-list envelope or per-file patches use the Changes L2/L3 API.
- A slim `file` part is a reference, not renderable content. Clients must hydrate the full message (`session.message` by `messageID`) before painting or editing the attachment. Do not treat slim file metadata as a complete part.
- Records that gain nothing from projection keep their original object reference, so identity-based change detection downstream still works.
- Projection applies to every turn-page response, including first packet, prepend, and explicit cursors (`before` present). Reconcile routes return full parts, unchanged.

**Consumer requirement:** recovery and materialize tails omit `before`, and prepend pages now share the same projection, so all turn-page consumers receive slim parts. Any consumer merging these records must treat `slim: true` as lower-ranked than content it already holds, or tool output will visibly degrade. `packages/ui/src/sync/displayParts.ts` implements that hold; do not add a second merge path without it.

The web client's store layer needs no separate hold: its page reducer merges tool `state` field-wise rather than replacing the part, so a projected page that omits `output` leaves the stored `output` intact. This was verified by neutralizing the render-layer hold and asserting the stored state directly — do not add a redundant guard in `transcript-merge.ts` on the assumption that it degrades.

`packages/vscode/src/session-turn-page-runtime.ts` mirrors this projection and must stay in parity.

## Host cursor format

Versioned self-describing token:

- Prefix: `oc1.`
- Body: base64url(JSON) of `{ "v": 1, "before": string | null, "boundaryID": string }`
  - `before`: the **raw upstream request-before** used to fetch the page that contained `boundaryID` (`null` = latest page / no before).
  - `boundaryID`: message id of the earliest authored user returned in that response.

On resume:

1. Strict decode / shape / length validation of the host token.
2. First `fetchPage` uses the token’s raw upstream `before`.
3. Locate `boundaryID` in that page; keep only records strictly older than it (`slice(0, index)` in old→new order). Boundary and newer rows are excluded.
4. If fewer than N turns remain, continue with that raw page’s `x-next-cursor` for older pages.
5. Each accumulated record records its upstream page’s request-before origin; when `complete=false`, the next host cursor encodes the earliest selected authored user’s origin + id.

A raw OpenCode SDK cursor (no `oc1.` prefix) is still accepted as the first `before` and is passed through unchanged to `fetchPage`.

Malformed host tokens, missing/stale `boundaryID`, or `before` longer than 8192 → `invalid_cursor` → HTTP 400.

## Turn boundary predicate

A message is an authored user turn boundary when:

1. `(clientRole ?? role) === 'user'`
2. Not a hosted session divider (`info.id` starts with `oc_asst_session_divider:`)
3. Not a message whose parts include `subtask` or `compaction`
4. Not fully synthetic (every part has `synthetic: true`) — loop / plan / shell injections
5. Empty `parts` on a user message **does** count as a boundary
6. Mixed real + synthetic parts **does** count as a boundary

## Aggregation rules

- Upstream pages are chronological **old→new** within each page; **do not reverse**. Older pages are **prepended** while deduping by `info.id` (global order remains old→new).
- Continues paging with raw upstream `before` until `turns` authored boundaries are collected or upstream reports no next cursor.
- Every upstream record must have a non-empty `info.id`; otherwise structured error, no partial `records`, HTTP 502.
- Hard scan caps (no partial success): **50 pages** / **5000 messages** → structured error, HTTP 413.
- Repeated / stalled cursor, or empty page that still carries a next cursor → structured error, no partial `records`, HTTP 502.
- Malformed upstream payloads and SDK/transport failures → HTTP 502 (`error: "upstream"`).
- `AbortSignal` is forwarded to each `session.messages` call; route also applies a 45s linked timeout.
- Request abort only when the client disconnects mid-flight: `req` aborted, or `res` `close` while `!res.writableEnded`. A normal GET request `close` after the response has ended must not abort.

## Anchor reconcile API

### Request

```http
GET /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionID/messages/reconcile
  ?directory=<workspace>
  &anchor=<messageID>
  &continuation=<opaque-token>
```

| Param | Notes |
|---|---|
| `anchor` | First request only. Stable server-confirmed message id (turn boundary). Max 512 chars. |
| `continuation` | Subsequent pages. Host opaque signed token (`ocr2.<payload>.<mac>`). Mutually exclusive with `anchor`. Max 8192 chars. |
| `directory` | Optional path forwarded to directory-scoped OpenCode client; bound into continuation. |

Provide **exactly one** of `anchor` or `continuation`. Invalid params → HTTP 400.

### Response (`200`)

```json
{
  "records": [{ "info": { "id": "..." }, "parts": [] }],
  "anchorFound": true,
  "capturedHeadMessageID": "msg_latest_at_round_start",
  "latestHeadMessageID": "msg_latest_probe",
  "continuation": "ocr2.…",
  "complete": false,
  "resetRequired": false,
  "scannedRecords": 42,
  "responseBytes": 1200
}
```

- `records`: chronological oldest → newest for this response page. Includes the **overlap turn** starting at the anchor user (and subsequent assistant/tool rows) so in-progress parts and finish updates re-enter recovery merge.
- `anchorFound`: true once the anchor id has been located in the scanned window (may be true on a later continuation page).
- `capturedHeadMessageID`: head message id fixed for the reconcile **round** (first latest-page fetch).
- `latestHeadMessageID`: when `complete` and not `resetRequired`, a fresh head probe; otherwise equals captured head.
- `continuation`: host token for the next page; `null` when `complete` is true.
- `complete`: no further pages for this round (gap delivered, or terminal reset).
- `resetRequired`: client must drop transcript Query and rebuild from authoritative tail. True when:
  - history exhausted without finding the anchor; or
  - total page/byte budget of the round is hit before the gap is complete.
- Natural exhaustion and budget rebuild both use **HTTP 200** (not 4xx/5xx).

### Continuation binding and lifetime

Signed token format:

```text
ocr2.<base64url(json-payload)>.<base64url(hmac-sha256(payload))>
```

Payload (never message content or parts):

```ts
{
  v: 2,
  runtime: string,          // host runtime key (OPENCHAMBER_RUNTIME or inject)
  directory: string | null,
  sessionID: string,
  anchor: string,
  capturedHead: string,
  scanBefore: string | null, // raw upstream before for older history (null = re-fetch latest)
  returnedThroughID: string | null, // oldest id already returned; resume slices older than it
  scannedRecords: number,
  scannedBytes: number,
  pagesEmitted: number,
  iat: number,              // issued-at unix seconds
  exp: number,              // expiry unix seconds
}
```

Security / lifecycle:

- MAC: Node `crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)` over the base64url payload; verified with `timingSafeEqual`.
- Default secret: process-ephemeral random 32 bytes. **Host restart invalidates all outstanding continuations** (`invalid_continuation` → HTTP 400); client must restart the round from `anchor`.
- Default TTL: 15 minutes. Expired tokens → `invalid_continuation` (HTTP 400).
- Rejects: legacy unsigned `ocr1.*`, wrong MAC, wrong secret, structural anomalies, unknown keys, binding mismatches (runtime/directory/session/anchor/captured head).
- Service options for tests: `continuationSecret`, `clock`, `continuationTtlMs`.

### Budgets (server-owned)

| Budget | Default | Env override |
|---|---|---|
| Per-page records | 100 | `OPENCHAMBER_SESSION_RECONCILE_PAGE_RECORDS` (1..500) |
| Per-page JSON bytes | 512 KiB | `OPENCHAMBER_SESSION_RECONCILE_PAGE_BYTES` |
| Total pages / round | 20 | `OPENCHAMBER_SESSION_RECONCILE_TOTAL_PAGES` (1..100) |
| Total scanned bytes / round | 5 MiB | `OPENCHAMBER_SESSION_RECONCILE_TOTAL_BYTES` |

When the per-page budget fills before the gap is complete, the host returns `continuation` and HTTP 200. When the **total** round budget hits without completing the gap, the host returns `resetRequired: true` and HTTP 200.

### Reconcile scan rules

- Upstream pages chronological old→new; older pages prepended with id dedupe.
- First request of a round captures head from the latest page, then walks older until anchor or budgets/history end.
- Continuation re-slices already-returned suffix via `returnedThroughID` and resumes older history via `scanBefore`.
- Missing id / empty+cursor / stalled cursor → structured error, no partial success body for that error path, HTTP 502.
- OpenCode temporary failures → `upstream` (502) or `unavailable` (503).
- Unexpected server exceptions → HTTP 500; logger records full stack with session id and flag fields only (no auth headers, no message/parts content).

## Registration

```js
// feature-routes-runtime.js (before generic proxy composition)
registerSessionTurnPageRoutes(app, {
  buildOpenCodeUrl,
  getOpenCodeAuthHeaders,
});
```

Inside `registerSessionTurnPageRoutes`, registration order is: reconcile → turn-page messages → exact `GET /api/session/:sessionID/message/:messageID` → Changes. All of these register before the generic OpenCode proxy in `feature-routes-runtime.js`. Electron reuses this same Host composition in-process.
