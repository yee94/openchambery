# Session Goal

Server-side control loop that keeps a session working toward a user-defined
objective stored under `metadata.openchamber.goal`, with the small model as
an independent progress auditor. Built on OpenChamber's backend-driven
architecture: the loop lives in
the web server and survives UI disconnects.

## Goal payload (`metadata.openchamber.goal`)

```
{
  id,                      // opaque per-logical-goal id; stale-write guard
  objective,               // inline user text (fallback), <= 5000 chars
  objectiveFile,           // true: objective text lives in a server-side file
  status,                  // active | paused | blocked | budgetLimited | complete
  tokenBudget,             // optional positive int
  tokensUsed,              // tokensCommitted + current segment (snapshot - baseline)
  tokensBaseline,          // segment start snapshot (pre-goal turn; 0 after compaction)
  tokensCommitted,         // closed segments' total (one segment per compaction)
  turnsUsed,               // auto-continuations sent (capped at MAX_AUTO_TURNS)
  blockedStreak,           // consecutive blocked audit verdicts
  auditFailStreak,         // consecutive failed/unavailable audit calls
  note,                    // latest audit progress note, <= 280 chars
  statusReason,            // why settled; 'resumed' is a kickoff signal from UI
  lastAccountedMessageID,  // incremental accounting cursor
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

The UI writes goals (create/edit/pause/resume/clear) by patching this
metadata; the runtime never creates a goal on its own. Goal creation happens
at send time via the arm store (`useSessionGoalArmStore`): the composer
target button arms "the next prompt is the objective", and the run-as-goal
flows (fork-from-answer dialog, plan implement dialog) arm the same way —
the plan flow additionally supplies an objective OVERRIDE carrying the plan
content, since "Implement this plan: X" alone gives the audit nothing to
judge against. The armed send also attaches a synthetic system-reminder
part telling the agent goal mode is active and that each turn should end
with a factual done/verified/remaining statement for the independent audit.
Freshness/stale-write protection is by `id`: every runtime write re-reads the
session and drops the write when the stored goal id no longer matches.

## File-backed objectives

The objective TEXT lives in `<data-dir>/goals/<sessionId>.md` (data dir =
`OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR` or `~/.config/openchamber`), keyed by the SESSION ID:
sessions are globally unique and carry one goal at a time, so the mapping is
deterministic and a new goal simply overwrites the file. Metadata carries
only `objectiveFile: true` — never a path — so user-writable metadata cannot
become a file-read vector (`objectives.js` also validates the id shape
before touching the filesystem). Rationale: metadata rides every
`session.updated`, so multi-KB objectives must not live there.

- `objectives.js` — write/read/delete, 5000-char clamp.
- `routes.js` — `PUT/GET/DELETE /api/goals/objective/:sessionId`
  (OpenChamber-owned, registered before the generic proxy; JSON parsing via
  the `/api/goals` family in core-routes). The UI writes the file BEFORE
  patching the goal metadata and falls back to an inline objective when the
  write fails; `clearSessionGoal` deletes the file best-effort.
- The tick resolves the effective objective fresh on every cycle (the file
  is live-editable mid-goal) and falls back to the inline `objective` when
  the file is unreadable — a goal never dies because a file went away.
- UI display fetches content via the GET route
  (`useGoalObjectiveContent`); in VS Code the route is unavailable, so the
  strip degrades to the audit note (display-only fallback by design).
- Scheduled goal tasks write the file server-side directly via
  `objectives.js`.

## Flow

1. `createSessionGoalRuntime` subscribes to the global SSE hub (it needs
   the envelope's `directory`).
2. `session.status: idle` arms a 15s per-session timer; `busy`/`retry` clears
   it. A `session.updated` carrying a fresh active goal (`turnsUsed === 0` or
   `statusReason === 'resumed'`) arms a kickoff timer — 3s for fresh goals,
   ~250ms for an explicit Resume so the nudge feels immediate — since setting
   a goal on an idle session emits no status transition.
3. On fire (`tick`), gated by the `sessionGoalEnabled` setting:
   - fetch session (skip sub-agent sessions), require an `active` goal;
   - quiescence check via the message tail (trailing user message or
     unfinished assistant reply → bail; the next idle transition re-arms).
     Exception: an unfinished assistant reply that also carries no error can
     be an ORPHAN left by force-killing the app mid-turn — the session is
     really idle even though the tail looks incomplete. In that case the tick
     corroborates against the live `/session/status` and, if the session is
     idle, resumes past the orphan instead of bailing forever. A genuinely
     busy session still bails;
   - token accounting as a SNAPSHOT of the latest completed assistant turn:
     `input + cache.read + output`. Earlier turns' inputs and outputs fold
     into the next turn's cache, so the latest snapshot already carries the
     whole run's paid tokens — no summing across messages. Goal-relative via
     `tokensBaseline` (the same snapshot of the newest pre-goal turn,
     captured on the first tick). Compaction (an assistant message with
     `summary: true`) breaks the snapshot chain, so accounting is segmented:
     the summary message closes the segment into `tokensCommitted` (the
     summary turn read the whole context, so its snapshot prices the
     compaction itself) and the next segment starts with a zero baseline.
     `tokensUsed = tokensCommitted + current segment`, kept monotonic so
     unflagged context shrinks never move the budget backwards;
    - a user abort pauses the goal instead of blocking it: the event path in
      `processPayload` pauses immediately on the MessageAbortedError message
      (before any tick could send a continuation over the user's explicit
      stop), with a tick-side safety net. Messages sent while paused leave
      the goal alone; Resume re-arms the loop, and resuming over an aborted
      tail skips the audit and goes straight to a continuation nudge;
    - `question.asked` also pauses an active goal (including when a child /
      sub-agent session asks — the parent session's goal is the one paused)
      but does NOT abort the current turn: aborting would kill the pending
      question. After the user answers, they Resume manually to re-arm
      the loop;
   - terminal checks, cheapest first: assistant turn error → `blocked`;
     `tokensUsed >= tokenBudget` → `budgetLimited`;
     `turnsUsed >= MAX_AUTO_TURNS` (20) → `blocked`;
   - if the latest message is a compaction summary, skip the audit and
     continue unconditionally — running into the context window mid-work is
     by definition "in progress, not finished" (the summary is a retelling,
     not evidence, and must not be judged);
   - otherwise, small-model audit of the objective + the last assistant turn
     only — no conversation history and no continuation prompts
     (`restrictToPreferredProvider`, session's own provider/model preferred):
     JSON `{verdict: continue|complete|blocked, note}`. The audit is the SOLE
     termination authority besides the hard stops above — the working agent
     has no channel to settle its own goal. `complete` settles; `blocked`
     increments `blockedStreak` and settles only after 3 consecutive blocked
     verdicts, so a one-off snag cannot end the goal. Audit failure/absence
     tolerates ONE consecutive unaudited continuation (`auditFailStreak`); a
     second consecutive failure settles the goal as `blocked` ("progress
     audit unavailable") — resumable, and settling resets the streak so
     Resume gets fresh tolerance. A dead small model can never drive the
     loop blind to the turn cap;
   - continue: persist accounting + `turnsUsed` first (a crash after the
     write just waits for the next idle tick; the reverse could double-send),
     re-check the tail, then `POST /session/:id/prompt_async` with the
     continuation prompt using the last assistant message's
     provider/model/agent — the goal spends the session's own subscription.
4. Settling (`complete`/`blocked`/`budgetLimited`) fires the injected
   `emitGoalNotification` so the user hears about it even with the UI closed.
   The same settle also notifies a registered Assistant contact reporter
   (`setAssignedSessionSettleHandler`) so an assigned/watched session updates
   its contact card — read-only, no second scheduler:
   desktop + UI broadcast + the standard push fanout (web-push with full
   text; APNs with a generic per-type title and the session name as body).
   It obeys the notify-on-completion setting. Conversely, while a goal is
   ACTIVE the notifications runtime suppresses per-turn "ready"
   notifications on every channel — they would only echo the loop's own
   continuations; error/question/permission notifications are untouched.
    Pausing a goal from the UI also aborts the running turn (and vice versa —
    an abort pauses the goal), so "stop" means stop on both axes. A
    `question.asked` pause is the exception: it only writes `status: paused`
    and leaves the waiting turn intact.

## Continuation prompt

Built inline in `runtime.js`: the objective as untrusted user data in an
XML-escaped `<objective>` block, budget numbers, keep-the-full-objective and
work-from-evidence rules, a completion-audit instruction, and the requirement
to end every turn with a factual done/verified/remaining report — the audit
sees only that final turn, so the report is its evidence.

## UI consumers (packages/ui)

- `lib/sessionGoalMetadata.ts` — payload parsing/types.
- `lib/sessionGoalActions.ts` — create/edit/pause/resume/clear via
  `patchSessionMetadata`; `lib/sessionGoalPresentation.ts` — status
  colors/labels shared across surfaces.
- `stores/useSessionGoalArmStore.ts` — the "next prompt starts a goal" flag,
  consumed by `sendMessage` in `sync/session-ui-store.ts` (works for drafts).
- `hooks/useSessionGoal.ts` — live goal state.
- `components/chat/SessionGoalButton.tsx` — composer target button
  (arm / status color / cancel confirm); `SessionGoalRow.tsx` — goal strip
  above the composer; `SessionGoalDialog.tsx` — manage dialog
  (edit/pause/resume/complete/clear).
- Sidebar glyph next to the date in `SessionNodeItem`.

## Scheduled goals

Scheduled tasks can run as goals: `execution.goalEnabled` (+ optional
`execution.goalTokenBudget`) on a task makes the scheduled-tasks runtime
stamp `metadata.openchamber.goal` onto the fresh session (objective = the
expanded task prompt) and attach the goal-mode intro part to the prompt.
The loop here picks it up from session events like any other goal.

## Limitations

- TODO(watch): Assistant contact assign skipped a watch tool this slice.
  Goal settle already notifies. Do not invent a second scheduler. A later
  thin contact tool can post a read-only session status card when
  `metadata.openchamber.goal` settles.
- Web-server feature: VS Code (extension-only) renders goal state via
  `session.updated` but does not run the loop.
- A goal on a session with no assistant reply yet starts after the first
  user exchange completes (no provider/model to continue with before that).
- `tokensUsed` only counts completed assistant messages seen within the
  40-message fetch window per tick; extremely long busy stretches between
  idles undercount (acceptable: budget is a guardrail, not billing).
